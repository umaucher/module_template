Example: Detailed Design
========================

.. document:: [Your Component Name] Detailed Design
   :id: doc__mod_temp_component_name_detailed_design
   :status: draft
   :version: 1
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :security: NO
   :realizes: wp__sw_implementation
   :tags: template

.. attention::
    The above directive must be updated according to your Component.

    - Modify ``Your Component Name`` to be your Component Name
    - Modify ``id`` to be your Component Name in upper snake case preceded by ``doc__`` and followed by ``_detailed_design``
    - Adjust ``status`` to be ``valid``
    - Adjust ``safety`` and ``tags`` according to your needs

Detailed Design for Component: <Component Name>
===============================================

Description
-----------

| Design Decisions - For the documentation of the decision the :need:`gd_temp__change_decision_record` can be used.
| Design Constraints

Example:

 - component is split into two units unit1 and unit2 based on single responsibility principle.
 - unit2 is injected to unit1 one via dependency injection for testability.

Rationale Behind Decomposition into Units
******************************************
| mandatory: a motivation for the decomposition into one or more units.

.. note:: Reason for split into multiple units could be-
	    - Based on design principles like SOLID,DRY etc
	    - Based on design pattern's etc.

Static Diagrams for Unit Interactions
-------------------------------------

A static view provides an overview of the units and their relationships using
UML 2.0 notations (e.g. class diagrams, component diagrams). Use ``.. uml::``
or ``.. image::`` directives to include the diagram.

.. uml:: dd_example_ex_sta.puml

Dynamic Diagrams for Unit Interactions (optional)
--------------------------------------------------

A dynamic view illustrates how the units within a component interact over their
interfaces to fulfill a specific use case or functionality. It is optional when the
component's behaviour is straightforward and can be understood from the static view
and interface documentation alone.

Use standard UML behavioural diagrams (sequence diagrams, state machine diagrams)
with ``.. uml::`` or ``.. image::`` directives.

.. uml:: dd_example_ex_dyn.puml

Units within the Component
--------------------------

The relationship between a unit and its parent component is established implicitly
through the file path. Each component has its own directory, and units residing
within that directory belong to it. The unit's attributes and behaviour are documented
in the source code itself. A separate static diagram per unit is not required.

Interface documentation of a software unit is part of the source code (e.g. public
API headers, trait definitions, or documented function signatures).

Example:

- unit1: implements the main logic (see source code for details)
- unit2: injected into unit1 via dependency injection for testability
