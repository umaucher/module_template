.. attention::
    The above directive must be updated according to your Module.

    - Modify ``Your Module Name`` to be your Module Name
    - Modify ``id`` to be your Module Name in upper snake case preceded by ``doc_`` and succeeded by ``security_plan``
    - Adjust ``status`` to be ``valid``

  | **1. Security Management Context**
  | This Security Plan adds to the process security management guidance all the module development relevant work products needed for ISO SAE 21434 conformity.
   |
   | **2. Security Management Scope**
   | This Security Plan's scope is a SW module of the SW platform <link to module documentation in platform/modules/<modulename>/index.rst>.
   | The module consists of one or more SW components and will be qualified as a OoC.
   |
   | **3. Security Management Roles**

   +---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Security Manager          | <link to Module's Security Manager assignment or name>       |
   +---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Project Manager           | <link to Module's Project Lead assignment or name>           |
   +---------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

  | **4. Tailoring**
  | Additional to the tailoring in the SW platform project as defined in the process security management guidance we define here the additional tailoring on module level.
   |
   | - Excluded for this module are additionally the following work products (and their related requirements):
   |   - <ISO SAE 21434 reference>: <work product/requirement> - <Argumentation why it is not needed or replaced by another work product or activity.>
   |
   | **5. Security Module Work Products**
   | One set of work products for the module and one set for each component of the module:
