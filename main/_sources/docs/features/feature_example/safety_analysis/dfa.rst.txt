DFA (Dependent Failure Analysis)
================================

.. document:: [Your Feature Name] DFA
   :id: doc__feature_name_dfa
   :status: draft
   :version: 1
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :security: NO
   :realizes: wp__feature_dfa
   :tags: template

.. note:: Use the content of the document to describe e.g. why a fault model is not applicable for the diagram.

.. attention::
    The above directive must be updated according to your Feature.

    - Modify ``Your Feature Name`` to be your Feature Name
    - Modify ``id`` to be your Feature Name in upper snake case preceded by ``doc__`` and succeeded by ``_dfa``
    - Adjust ``status`` to be ``valid``
    - Adjust ``safety`` and ``tags`` according to your needs

The DFA for the feature [Your Feature Name] is performed. To show evidence that all failure initiators are considered, the applicability has to be filled out in the
following tables. For all applicable failure initiators, the DFA has to be performed.

Dependent Failure Initiators
----------------------------

Shared resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The dependent failure initiators related to shared resources are not applicable for the features. The shared resources
will be considered in the platform DFA.

Communication between the two elements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Receiving function is affected by information that is false, lost, sent multiple times, or in the wrong order etc. from the sender.

.. list-table:: DFA communication between elements

  :widths: 10,20,10,20

  * - ID
    - Violation cause communication between elements
    - Applicability
    - Rationale
  * - CO_01_01
    - Information passed via argument through a function call, or via writing/reading a variable being global to the two software functions (data flow)
    - <yes | no>
    - <Rationale if not applicable, otherwise link to filled out DFA>

DFA
===

For all identified applicable failure initiators, the DFA is performed in the following section.

.. code-block:: rst

    .. feat_saf_dfa:: <Title>
       :violates: <Feature architecture>
       :id: feat_saf_dfa__<Feature>__<Element descriptor>
       :failure_id: <ID from DFA failure initiators :need:`gd_guidl__dfa_failure_initiators`>
       :failure_effect: "description of failure effect of the failure initiator on the element"
       :mitigated_by: <ID from Feature Requirement | ID from AoU Feature Requirement>
       :mitigation_issue: <ID from Issue Tracker>
       :sufficient: <yes|no>
       :status: <valid|invalid>

 .. note::   Argument is inside the 'content'. Therefore content is mandatory.

.. attention::
    The above directive must be updated according to your feature DFA.

    - The above "code-block" directive must be updated
    - Fill in all the needed information in the <brackets>
