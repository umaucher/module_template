.. document:: [Your Feature Name] Security WPs
   :id: doc__feature_example_security_planning_wp
   :status: draft
   :safety: ASIL_B
   :security: YES
   :realizes: wp__platform_security_plan
   :tags: template

.. attention::
    The above directive must be updated according to your Feature.

    - Modify ``Your Feature Name`` to be your Feature Name
    - Modify ``id`` to be your Module Name in upper snake case preceded by ``doc__`` and succeeded by ``_security_wp``
    - Adjust ``status`` to be ``valid``
    - Adjust ``safety`` and ``tags`` according to your needs

Tailoring
=========

Additional to the tailoring in the SW platform project as defined in the project's :need:`wp__platform_security_plan` we define here the additional tailoring on feature level.

- Excluded for this feature are additionally the following work products (and their related requirements):

  - <work product/requirement> - <Argumentation why it is not needed or replaced by another work product or activity.>

Feature Security Package
========================

To create the security package (according to :need:`gd_guidl__security_package`) the following
documents and work products status have to go to "valid" (after the relevant verification were performed).

Feature Documents Status
------------------------

For all the work product documents the status can be seen by following the "Link to WP".
A summary of the status is also documented in the project's documentation management plan.

See <add here the section reference to the documentation management plan>
