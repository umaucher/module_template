Safety Analysis Checklist
=========================

.. document:: [Your Module Name] Safety Analysis Checklist
  :id: doc__mod_temp_module_name_safety_analysis_fdr
  :status: draft
  :version: 1
  :safety: ASIL_B
  :security: YES
  :realizes: wp__fdr_reports
  :tags: template

.. attention::
    The above directive must be updated according to your Module.

    - Modify ``Your Module Name`` to be your Module Name
    - Modify ``id`` to be your Module Name in lower snake case preceded by ``doc__`` and followed by ``_safety _analysis_fdr``
    - Adjust ``status`` to be ``valid``
    - Adjust ``safety``, ``security`` and ``tags`` according to your needs


**Purpose**

The purpose of this Safety Analysis (DFA and FMEA) formal review report template is to collect the topics to be checked during verification of the Safety Analysis.

**Conduct**

As described in :need:`wf__p_formal_rv`, the formal document review is performed by an "external" safety manager:

- reviewer: **<committer with safety manager skills explicitly named here>**
- scope: **<describe the scope of the review here, e.g. "the safety analysis of the module and its results">**

**Checklist**

Please note that it is mandatory to fill in the "passed" column with "yes" or "no" for each checklist item and additional to add in the remarks why it is passed or not passed. In case of "no" an issue link to the issue tracking system has to be added in the last column. See also :need:`doc_concept__wp_inspections` for further information about reviews in general and inspection in particular.
